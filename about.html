<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a new software developer based in Colorado. I previously worked as a veterinarian before discovering a passion for software development. I am actively re-training to hone my skillset through CodeCademy and Udemy. 
  I have two cats who love to see what I'm working on. My hobbies include video games, drawing and reading. In my free time I like to work with birds of prey and teach kids throughtout the state of Colorado about them.
